This mod adds potions that highlight corrupt, crimson, and hallow blocks in much the same way as the spelunker potion highlights ores.
The potions are crafted with Blinkroot, Moonglow and one of the following:
- 3x Demonite Ore
- 3x Crimtane Ore
- 3x Pixie Dust

These will make a potion that reveals the respective type of blocks.
